Human Activity Recognition using Optical Flow based Feature Set

1. GMM and Optical flow  For foreground  extract  of interest 
2. centre of gravity of the foreground 
3. computer the optical flow vectors along the boundaries (360 degree /5k= 72 points)
4. intersect point from shape of frame-Logical 
5.
