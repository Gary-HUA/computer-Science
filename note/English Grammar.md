 3. 宁愿做某事
	would rather do sth (than do sth)
    would do sth, rather than do sth.
    would rather sb did sth
    prefer to do sth. 
    perfer to do sth rather than do sth
    prefer doing sth to doing sth.
虚拟语气:
    1. 条件虚拟语气.
    	过去时态: had done,  would /should have done. if i had time, i would have dropped by. 
        现在时态: were/did , would/should do. if i were you, i would refuse the money.
        未来: were/did, were to do, should do,  would/should do.if you came/were to come/should come tomorrow, i would give it to you.
    2. if 省略句
    	在条件句中, 可以省略if, 把were,had, should提到句首, 标为倒装句.(否定不缩写) were i you, i would take his advice.
        if you had followed his advice, you would be better mow(条件句是表示过去的虚拟, 主句是对现在的虚拟.)
   3. should 表示虚拟:
    	表示建议, 愿望,命令等词后的宾语从句中,可以归纳为一坚持insist, 二命令(order, command),三建议(advice, suggest, propose),四要求(demand, desine, require, request)
        He suggested that we (should) start off early the next day.
        They insisted that the boy(should) go with them.
       	用过去式表示虚拟, 需要向前推一个时态. i wish (that) i had accepted it yesterday.
        if only + 从句:  only if 只有...才
            要是...就好了, if only i were a boy. 
            只要, if only he comes, i will come.
            但愿, if only he comes here early.
            
  1. 与现在事实相反的虚拟：

If + did / were + ..., ... would/ should/ could/ might + do （动词原形）

If I were you, I would go abroad at once. (I am not you.)

If he knew it now, he could help me. (He doesn't know it now.)

2. 与过去事实相反的虚拟：

If + had done + ..., ... would (might) have done ...

If I had known your telephone number yesterday, I would have phoned you. (I didn't know your telephone number.)

If you had come here a little earlier just now, you might have met her. (You didn't come here earlier.)

3. 与将来事实相反的虚拟：

(1) If + should + v., ... would + v. （可能性很小）（译作“万一”）

If it should rain tomorrow, you could stay at home.

If I should fail, what should Ido?

(2) If + did / were to + v ..., would + v. （完全不可能）

If the sun were to rise in the west, I would lend you the money.

If you finished it in 3 minutes, I would give you my car.

4. 特殊重点

［简单联想记忆］：

● 下列动词后的“宾语从句”中需要用虚拟形式，即should + 动词原形，shoud在美国英语中要省略（TOEFL语法考点）。此类常见的动词有：order, ask, decide, demand, require, recommend, suggest（建议）, insist（坚决要求）, advise, etc.

He suggested that we (should) help them with English.

The teacher ordered that the homework (should) be finished within half an hour.

● 下列名词后的同位语从句中要用“should + 动词原形”（should可省去）的虚拟。此类常见的名词有：suggestion, order, request, demand, importance, proposal.

He made a suggestion that we (should) have a fancy dress party.

I think it is a thing of importance that it (should) be done soon.

● It is / was important / necessary / natural / essential / advisable / strange / surprising, ect. + that +主语+ should + v.

It is strange that you should say such a thing.

It was important that you should tell me all the information.

● wish后的宾语从句中，as if 后的状语从句中，须用下列的虚拟形式：

主 + wish+ (that) + 主 + did / were（指现在）

had done（指过去）

would+ v.（指将来）

I wish that I met my uncle now.

I wish I had met my uncle yesterday.

I wish I could meet my uncle tomorrow.
